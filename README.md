1. NFsim model and simulations: 
We generate the two components bngl files (http://bionetgen.org/) using a custom python script (file 00); three components files (Nephrin-Nck-NWASP system) are written manually. The bngl file (file 01) is then converted to a .xml file (file 02); detailed methods can be found here https://emonet.biology.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/NFsim_manual_v1_11.pdf.  The xml file is then used as an input file to run multiple stochastic trajectories. The jobs are executed in a high performance computing facility https://health.uconn.edu/high-performance-computing/ using a custom shell script (file 03). Each trajectory or run would generate two output files - one containing the observables data (Run_x.gdat) and another containing the molecular clusters at the last time point of simulations (Run_x.species). Once we have multiple stochastic runs, we use another python script (file 04) to compute two variables - a. average counts of obvervables across multiple runs b. distributions of molecular clusters at the last time point (note that the distribution does not correspond to a steady state when total concentration diverges with time in "CMC" simulations).
