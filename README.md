1. NFsim model and simulations: 
We generate the two components bngl files (http://bionetgen.org/) using a custom python script (file 00); three components files (Nephrin-Nck-NWASP system) are written manually. The bngl file (file 01) is then converted to a .xml file (file 02); detailed methods can be found here https://emonet.biology.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/NFsim_manual_v1_11.pdf.  The xml file is then used as an input file to run multiple stochastic trajectories. The jobs are parallely executed in a high performance computing facility https://health.uconn.edu/high-performance-computing/ using a custom shell script (file 03). Each trajectory or run would generate two output files - one containing the observables data (Run_x.gdat) and another containing the molecular clusters at the last time point of simulations (Run_x.species). Once we have multiple stochastic runs, we use another python script (file 04) to compute two variables - a. average counts of obvervables (Free or Total molecular concentration) across multiple runs b. distributions of molecular clusters at the last time point (note that the distribution does not correspond to a steady state when total concentration diverges with time in "CMC" simulations). 
For "FTC" method, we gradually increase molecular counts (100, 200, 300, ..., 1000) at fixed Kd (3500 molecules) to titrate up the concentrations; creation and decay rates are set to zero to make it a closed system. On the other hand, for "CMC" method, we begin with 1 molecules each (Kd = 3500 molecules) and increase the creation rates (1290000, 1300000, 1310000 molecules/s) with a fixed decay rate (10000 1/s) to titrate up the clamped concentrations.
